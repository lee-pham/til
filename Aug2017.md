* Python strings can be multiplied by integers.
* FizzBuzz, courtesy of [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc).
```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    out = ''
    if i % 3 == 0:
        out += 'Fizz'

    if i % 5 == 0:
        out += 'Buzz'

    if out == '':
        out = i

    print(out)

```
* Adding the name of the language after the three backticks (`) for code blocks gives the code syntax highlighting.
