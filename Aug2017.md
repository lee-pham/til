# August 2017

### _**Tuesday, August 1st**_
* Python strings can be multiplied by integers.

* FizzBuzz, courtesy of [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.c7om/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc).

```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    out = ''
    if i % 3 == 0:
        out += 'Fizz'

    if i % 5 == 0:
        out += 'Buzz'

    if out == '':
        out = i

    print(out)

```

* Adding the name of the language after the three backticks (`) for code blocks gives the code syntax highlighting.

* How to date.

 ```python
from datetime import datetime
date = 'AUG 01, 2017'
new_date = datetime.strptime(date, '%b %d, %Y').strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
print(new_date)
```

* tmux. Split the screen by pressing `Ctrl` and `b` at the same time, then entering `%`. Switch between tabs by `Ctrl b` and the arrow key.

* Setting up scheduled tasks in Cron to run once a minute

```bash
crontab -e
* * * * * <command here>
```

### _**Wednesday, August 2nd**_
* PostgreSQL

```sql
DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table>;
CREATE TABLE <new-table> as TABLE <table-to-copy-from>;
```

* Install `avahi-daemon` to get an easy `hostname.local` connection to your machine directly via ethernet.

* Use `allow-hotplug eno1` to save yourself from the headache of dealing with ubuntu's default network configuration.

    * Update: systems with two ethernet ports on ubuntu simply act differently... Solution to be determined.

### _**Thursday, August 3rd**_
* Python functions make life easier. Think `def function()` instead of

```python
a = """statement"""
eval(a)

def func():
    a = statement

func()
```

### _**Friday, August 4th**_
* Be patient with serial communication and pay attention to the buffer. 

### _**Monday, August 7th**_
* Having a loop run for a duration of time instead of iterations

```python
import time
duration = 5  # length of loop in seconds
end_time = time.time() + duration
while time.time() < end_time:
    pass
```

* Get hostname
```python
from socket import gethostname
print(gethostname())
```

* Log stdout on crontab
```bash
* * * * * python3 ~/script.py >> ~/script_log.txt
```

### _**Monday, August 21st**_
* How to insert data into postgres if the data is new:
```sql
INSERT INTO <table> VALUES ('', '', '', ..., '') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```
> Table must have a constraint so,
```sql
CREATE TABLE <table-name> (date date, number smallint, UNIQUE (date, number));
```


### _**Tuesday, August 22nd**_
* In postgres, Null values do not raise a conflict for the UNIQUE constraint.
